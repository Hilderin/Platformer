# Pong (FNA-XNA with FNAEngine2D)

The goal of this project is to have fun creating a little game with FNA-XNA and creating a little FNAEngine2D at the same time.

To build this project to will need to code the repo for FNAEngine2D: https://github.com/Hilderin/FNAEngine



# Dependencies

This projet uses:
- FNAEngine2D: https://github.com/Hilderin/FNAEngine
- FNA-XNA-Wrapper (a nuget that i created to bundle FNA in a nuget package. Weirdly, nobody seems to use created one for that easy to use before or i just did not find it?!?)
- Velentr.Font.FNA: For drawing text


# Work in progress

I just begun working with FNA-XNA, there's so must that can be added and upgraded.

My plan is to upgrade my Pong game with different goodies and upgrade the engine at the same time.
